# Beagles
 A number guessing game

In this game, a number from 0-999 will be randomly generated and you will have to guess it. You will have 10 guesses by default, which you can change and you will be given a clue about the number at every guess. 

Pico - one correct digit is in the correct place

Fermi - one correct digit is in the wrong place

Beagles - all the digits from your guess are not in the number at all
